First is how to parse the regex. You could parse it into an AST. 

^ENWWW(NEEE|SSE(EE|N))$

Which would be

East, North, West, West, West, 
  ChoiceOf
     North, East, East East
     South South East ChoiceOf
        East East 
        North 

But while generating the AST you could just be walking and producing the map.

Map format?

Options... 

Could be a 2d array. Efficient and easy to move about. Starts with ?.
  Tricky because size is unknown so you need to make it large and start in the middle and possibly
  have to do over.

Or a graph. A bit less efficient due to pointer chasing but at least the right size. Hard to draw?
  Each node can contain the X,Y coordinates which you can simply generate as you go.
  Then when you draw it start by finding the bounds.

TODO 

1. Generate the graph including the coordinates.
2. Make a draw function.
