For part2

for each evidence

-// Before: [1, 3, 1, 3]
-// 14 0 3 0
-// After:  [0, 3, 1, 3]

we want a map of opcode 

we can generate a list of opcodes that 14 could be

in fact we want a map of [opcode, set of candidates]

the set of candidates will be the index into the ops slice

run through the opcodes, if any of the candidate lists has one entry, we now know what that that entry is

since it's a known add to a map of known op codes

eg 13 => 0

and set opcde 0 (addr) opCode to 13

also remove for all candidates mention of opcode known

keep looping until either none of the opcodes has more than one candidate

or we stop making progress



brute force recursive approach

first find any that have only one candidate, these are now known

then generate the combinations of 0-15

opcode candidates
0      0,1,2
1      0,1
2      1,2

just need to find a permutation that works

oc = 0

just find recursively a mapping that works for all the op candidates
